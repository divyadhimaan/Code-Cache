# Code Cache

Code Cache is a web-based application designed to help software developers track and organize the coding problems they practice during their interview preparation. The platform allows users to store key details about each coding problem, such as the problem's title, difficulty level, associated topic, and useful links or resources.

## Key features of the application include:

- Question Tracking: Users can add coding problems they've practiced, including optional notes and resources, making it easier to revisit and revise difficult problems.
  
- Topic-based Organization: Problems can be categorized by predefined topics (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists), allowing users to filter and review problems based on the topics they want to focus on.
- Difficulty Levels: Users can specify the difficulty level of each problem, ranging from "Very Easy" to "Very Hard," making it easier to track progress and focus on challenging problems.
- Revision Tracking: Users can mark problems they wish to revise with a simple star rating system, allowing them to quickly identify problems they need to revisit.
- File Uploads: Users can upload markdown files containing notes related to a problem, keeping all resources in one place.
- Interactive Interface: The application features a clean, user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and viewing coding problems, offering a seamless experience for interview preparation.


Code Cache is an invaluable tool for anyone looking to stay organized while preparing for coding interviews. It allows users to track their progress, stay focused on specific topics, and continuously improve their problem-solving skills.
